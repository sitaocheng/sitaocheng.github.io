## About Me

I'm a third-year graduate student at [Nanjing University](https://njunju.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), advised by Prof. Yuzhong Qu. I obtain my bachelor degree at [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interests include question answering (QA) and knowledge graph (KG). Currently, I mainly focus on knowledge base question answering (**KBQA**) with semantic parsing-based methods. I have also conducted some research about recommender systems. I worked at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) as a full-time research intern for one year in 2022.
