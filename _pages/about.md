 Hi, I am Sitao Cheng(程思陶). I am a graduate student at [Websoft Lab](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/), Institude of Computer Science, Nanjing University, fortunated to be advised by Professor [Yuzhong Qu](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~yzqu). 
Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Microsoft DKI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/).
Currently, I am a visiting scholar at [UCSB NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/), fortunated to be advised by Professor [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html).

 My research mainly focuses on adopting language models (LMs) to reason over real-world environments(e.g. Knowledge Base, Tables, DBs). My interests include LM-agents, RAG and neural-symbolic grounding. Currently, I am doing research on the following topics:

1. Understanding and Application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (e.g. the mechanism and usage of RAG).        
2. LLMs interaction with structured environments (e.g. reasoning on KB).
3. Neural-symbolic Reasoning (Translate a natural language utterance to executable queries for precise reasoning).
4. Grounded Language Models (Ground a plan to real-world environments, e.g. KB, Tables, etc).
          
I'm seeking for 25 Fall Ph.D. opportunities! Feel free to reach out to me if you’re interested in my research!

I go to gym almost every day. I love body building (power lifting, swimming, crossfit, nutritions, etc). Let's be friends!
