Hi, I am Sitao Cheng. I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at University of Waterloo, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Victor Zhong](https://www.victorzhong.com/). I closely work with Prof. [Liangming Pan](https://liangmingpan.bio/) and Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/). Previously, I was a research scholar at UCSB NLP Group, advised by Prof. [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html). I obtained my Master's degree from Nanjing University. 
I also worked as a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/).



My research interest lies in advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs). I have experience on Language Agents, Reinforcement Learning, RAG and Neural-Symbolic Reasoning. Currently, I am doing research on the following topics:

1. Automatic Reward Modeling (e.g., exploration of differentiable evolutionary meta-reward).
2. The Role of RL in Compositional Generalization (e.g., how training strategies might affect generalizability, does RL really incentives new skills or merely amplifies).
3. Language Agents (e.g., reasoning on real-world environments).
          
Please feel free to reach out and discuss research! Please check out my [CV](https://sitaocheng.github.io/files/SitaoCheng_Academic_CV.pdf).
