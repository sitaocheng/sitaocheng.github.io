## About Me
 
My research interests focus on semantic parsing, i.e., the process of converting natural language utterance into logical form, and related tasks include knowledge base question answering (KBQA). 
I am interested in the following approaches: 1) grounding language models for semantic parsing, and 2) augmenting data for semantic parsing. Before that, I did some research on recommender systems. 
I received my degrees from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2023 and [Northeastern University (CN)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in 2020. I was a research intern at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) in 2022.
