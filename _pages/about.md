## About Me

Hi, I am Sitao Cheng. I am a visiting research scholar at [UCSB NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/), advised by Professor [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html). I also closely work with Professor [Liangming Pan](https://liangmingpan.bio/). 
 I obtained my Master degree from Nanjing University, advised by Professor [Yuzhong Qu](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~yzqu). 
I also worked as a research intern at [Microsoft DKI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/).

 My research interests lie in advancing the knowledge-intensive **reasoning capabilities** of language models (LMs). I have experience on Language Agents, RAG and Neural-Symbolic Reasoning. Currently, I am doing research on the following topics:

1. Understanding and improving reasoning capabilities (e.g., how LLMs adopts parametric and contextual knowledge for reasoning).
2. Language Agents (e.g., reasoning on real-world environments by information retrieval and semantic parsing).
3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (e.g., reasoning over knowledge graphs, efficient retrieval and better data organization paradigm).        
          
**I'm seeking for 25 Fall Ph.D. opportunities!** Please feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in my research! Please check out my [CV](https://sitaocheng.github.io/files/SitaoCheng_Academic_CV.pdf).
