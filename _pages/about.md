Hi, I am Sitao Cheng. I am an incoming Ph.D. Student at University of Waterloo, advised by Prof. [Victor Zhong](https://www.victorzhong.com/). Previously, I was a visiting research scholar at [UCSB NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/), advised by Prof.[William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html). I also closely work with Prof. [Liangming Pan](https://liangmingpan.bio/) and Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/). 
I obtained my Master's degree from Nanjing University, advised by Prof. [Yuzhong Qu](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~yzqu). 
I also worked as a research intern at [Microsoft DKI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/).

 My research interests lie in advancing the knowledge-intensive **reasoning capabilities** of language models (LMs). I have experience on Language Agents, RAG and Neural-Symbolic Reasoning. Currently, I am doing research on the following topics:

1. Understanding and improving reasoning capabilities (e.g., how LLMs adopts parametric and contextual knowledge for reasoning).
2. Language Agents (e.g., reasoning on real-world environments by information retrieval and semantic parsing).
3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (e.g., reasoning over knowledge graphs, efficient retrieval and better data organization paradigm).        
          
Please feel free to reach out to discuss research! Please check out my [CV](https://sitaocheng.github.io/files/SitaoCheng_Academic_CV.pdf).
